        I'm just a dude who is interested in IT, coding, community management, and technology in general. Feel free to reach out to me if you want to chat!

        <li>I am always working to become more like Jesus in thought and deed.</li>
        <li>I manage some communities on Reddit and Discord.</li>
        <li>I enjoy beautiful things, like the outdoors and viewing artwork.</li>
        <li>I enjoy learning new skills and getting better at existing ones. Currently, I'm interested in learning moer about Linux, programming, troubleshooting, and problem solving.</li>
        </p>
        <p>
        Since a young age, I have been interested in computers and how they work. This has helped me become familiar with Windows, Linux, and MacOS ecosystems as well as basic helpdesk/troubleshooting techniques.
        </p>
        <p>
        In some of my free time, I help as a global system operator at Wikipedia. This involves performing maintenance tasks various Wikipedia projects and occasional spam cleanup. At the time of writing, I also lead a few Reddit communities with a total of 23 million members and a Discord server with 17 thousand members!
        I've been able to automate some ruitine moderation tasks by writing filters and bots. It's also taught me a lot about customer service and conflict resolution! I'm open to doing freelance community management work!
        </p>
        <p> 
        Occasionally, Iâ€™ll play games like Counter-Strike: Global Offensive or Minecraft. Iâ€™m not a competitive or experienced gamer by any means, but itâ€™s fun to sit back and enjoy a gaming session with friends sometimes!
        </p>
        <p>
        Iâ€™m a firm believer in <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/touch_grass">touching grass</a> and highly recommend it. Get outside and do things! ðŸ˜€ Oh, and if you haven't received Jesus Christ's <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/">free gift of salvation</a>, you should look into that!
