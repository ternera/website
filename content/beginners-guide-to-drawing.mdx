## Where do I start?
If you're completely new to drawing, you start by learning how to see the world as shapes and angles. We've got a few exercises to learn that:

- [DAY 1: First day of Drawing? Start here!](http://www.colourcow.com/picasso-exercise/)

- [DAY 2: Grid Drawing](http://www.colourcow.com/grid-drawing/)

- [DAY 3: Still Lifes](http://www.colourcow.com/still-life-drawing/)

You could also go through a book like [Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain](https://amzn.to/4a6Hu0b). After that book, you can go through Fun with a Pencil to learn drawing humans (don't be turned off by the cartoons, it's a solid book) and [Perspective Made Easy](https://amzn.to/3Vc0BlC). For a completely free resource, check out drawabox.com

***But I can't even draw a stick figure! Are you sure about this?***

[Watch this. Tadaaam! Now you can draw more than a stick figure.](https://youtu.be/7TXEZ4tP06c?t=72)

If you are more experienced with drawing, post some of your recent work to /r/learntodraw ([submit here](https://www.reddit.com/r/learntodraw/submit)) for advice on which area to improve next.

You get better at drawing by drawing, so draw everyday! Even 5 minutes of random doodling keeps your hand and creativity alive. If you are not looking for exercises, but just ideas on what to draw, here's a list of ideas. Just pick one! mod note - create custom list including references make subchapter under "Motivation and Inspiration"

## Do I need talent?
No. Even if you're talent levels are in the negative, you will get better with practice. Talent gives you a headstart, but there are many born with talent who never practice and you'll even overtake them if you keep at it consistently. For reading up on practice versus talent, try [Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell](https://amzn.to/3TrvG3b).

**Consistency is key. Keep drawing.**

You can get by on pure technical skill. There are aspects of talent that you can copy to learn faster:

- having fun. By having fun, you can concentrate better and you're more likely to stick to it long-term.

- observation. Do you only draw when you are drawing? A talented person will look around daily life and notice how soft the edge of a cloud is, the shadow falling under someone's nose, the curious curve of a banana... all of this turns into a visual library that helps with drawing later on.

- self-critique. After drawing, notice what you did well and what you can improve. Now you know what to practice more and what to keep on doing! This help you study with focus.

Drawing is a bit like language learning - it's slow and requires a lot of practice, and even if you get fluent there's always more to learn. Even after six or ten or twenty years of drawing, you'll have more potential.

## I'm 20/36/78/x years old, am I too old to learn?
You can do it. Here are some before & after improvements of older artists:

Ehm, and your friendly mod Iris Hopp went from this: [First Month, 2012](http://www.colourcow.com/first-month/) to this: [Current Portfolio](http://www.irishopp.com/).

You are not too old, BUT you will make some crappy drawings. Kids make crappy drawings too, but they have fun and keep drawing. You'll need to keep yourself going while being an all self-conscious embarrassed adult. Stick to learning to draw for two months and then compare your early and later drawings. You'll see plenty of improvement!

## Is it okay to start with digital if I'm new to drawing?
It's better to start with pen and paper (or pencil and paper). If you use digital, you are learning on hard mode because you will also be learning how to handle a tablet and how to handle the drawing program that you are using. For example, smooth lines are more difficult to achieve in digital because a tablet pen is so sensitive. Secondly, traditional forces you to make decisions as you can't zoom in or erase endlessly. This makes your strokes more thoughtful and the feedback from the paper is crystal clear. Wait a few weeks before doing digital. Even then, maintaining a sketchbook is good practice!

## What material should I buy to start?
As a guideline: if you're a beginner, get cheap materials to burn through fast. Practice, practice! Once you improve a bit, you will get more use out of expensive materials.

**Drawing:** a stack of [cheap printing paper](https://amzn.to/3VatePP) and [some pencils](https://amzn.to/437KYgW) is enough!

If you want a sketchbook, [try this one](https://amzn.to/3wSLumI). A fancy sketchbook (like a [moleskine](https://amzn.to/4a1t9lS) or[ Paperblank](https://amzn.to/4a2K7QW) can hinder you, because you are afraid to "ruin it".

**Painting:** black and white tempera. Links: [black tempera](https://amzn.to/3PfJXOa), [white tempera](https://amzn.to/43aGtSL). [Here's a good brush set](https://amzn.to/3uZt8QB).

Check if your local art store has cheap paint in big tubs, [like this](https://amzn.to/3v2na1e). Gouache is also good, but a bit more expensive.

Tempera and gouache are cheaper than oil paint, a non-toxic paint and you only need water to clean the brushes. It's good to start with just black and white so you can focus on learning to control the brush, blending paint etc. You can buy colors after you have a feel for controlling the brush.

Later on you can get more fancy as you discover more drawing techniques, or have fun with new tools.

## How many hours should I draw every day? How long does it take to get good?
Your mileage might vary. We can't say how many hours you need or how many years it will take to become a good artist.

If you want to be a professional artist, treat it like a job and put in 40 hours a week. Minimum.

Hobbyist? It's all up to you. The only recommendation is drawing daily - even if it's just a five minute doodle, drawing daily keeps you fresh. For seeing improvement, an hour a day or more is good, because you'll see a measurable difference in your drawings as the months go by.

Have you heard of the 10 000-hour rule? 10 000 hours is seen as about the amount of time before you reach a proficient level in a skill. **This is 10 000 hours of deliberate practice, so consciously trying to improve and challenging yourself.**

# Can I make a living from art? How much do you get paid?
## Art Jobs
There's lots of jobs in art, and most of them are unknown to the public. You have the obvious ones, like the fine arts painters working for galleries, comic book artist and animators. Books and board games need illustrations. Apps need avatars and tutorial art. Technical drawings are needed for biolody text books and Ikea assembly instructions. There are also a lot of artists working in games and movies. For example, a high-quality video game will have a character designer, a creature designer, props and environment designer and so on. The illustrations used for posters are usually done by yet another artist!

There's also artists working with private clients, like portrait painters or even pet portrait painters. Check out /r/hungryartists for a glimpse of that. Artists also sell prints, like on Redbubble, or get money through Patreon.

Then there's jobs like art teacher, street caricature artist, etc. etc.

## How much do you earn as an artist?
Frankly, art is better for some beer money than as a full time career. It is highly competitive and you need to be above average before you are comfortable. If you draw decently, it's easy to pull in $20 commissions. An industry professional will ask minimum $35/hour, but this is the skill level expected at that pay rate: [example art](https://www.artstation.com/artwork/Jz9KR)

If you want to work at a great studio, you'll be competing with talents like Dina Norlund, Christine Bian and Tyler Edlin.

A top level artist can make $300k a year if they work full-time (think Feng Zhu, Craig Mullins, ...) but these are the top of the industry and it's not likely to get near that number.

In summary, a full-time artist could earn below poverty level all the way up to 6 figures.

## How do I develop a style?
There's two parts to developing a style:

1. Style grows on you. As you draw and draw, you have specific solutions that you use in drawing. What you see around you influences your inspiration - for example, if you have really big feet, you might draw characters with big feet!

2. If there is a style you want to mimic, find artists working in that style and study their work a lot. You can copy their drawings to understand their solutions. For example, by studying anime you'll figure out how to draw the minimalist, pointy chins and the large colorful eyes.

# Digital Drawing/Painting
## What program do I need?
If you have a very slow computer,[ Paint Tool SAI](https://www.systemax.jp/en/sai/) is the only program that will run smoothly. It has a 30-day free trial.

For a 100% free and versatile program, [Krita](https://krita.org/en/).

The industry standard amongst illustrators and concept artists is [Adobe Photoshop](https://amzn.to/48GGcrS). Photoshop (PS) works with a monthly subscription plan and is quite expensive. If you're currently a student, you can get it at a discount.

## What tablet should I buy?
A [cheap Wacom Bamboo](https://amzn.to/48G4ySw) will do. A budget of $100 will do fine, the only must-have is pen pressure, which is now standard on all Wacom tablets.

Wacom drivers can be found here: [driver download page](http://www.wacom.com/en/support/product-support/drivers)

Yes, there are $4000 tablets out there, but they won't help you learn faster. Instead, once you get good at painting and drawing, you can use these to push the limits of your skill. As a beginner, the price tag of your tablet will not make your work look better or worse.

If ~$80 is out of your budget, there's alternatives in the $40 range. Wacom has a few competitors, like [Monoprice](https://amzn.to/3TtZuMS). Quality varies, so we stick to recommending the Wacom Bamboo.

## Learning to paint digitally
The go-to resource for digital painting is [ctrlpaint.com](https://www.ctrlpaint.com/).

## Seeing the world as shapes and angles
Are you new to drawing? If it's your first day on this journey, this is where you start!

Right now, **grab a sheet of paper and a pencil and draw this picture:** [Stravinsky by Picasso](https://usercontent1.hubstatic.com/9505680_f520.jpg)

Yes, just like that, upside down. Why? When you're new to drawing, the first thing you have to learn is objectively seeing shapes and angles. When you turn it the right way round, you'll be surprised to see how well you did! No need to post this image for critique, it just marks your journey to changing how you see the world.

The sidebar has exercises to get you through your first week of drawing:

[DAY 1: First day of Drawing? Start here!](http://www.colourcow.com/picasso-exercise/)[ [*this is the exercise described above ^*]

[DAY 2: Grid Drawing](http://www.colourcow.com/grid-drawing/)

[DAY 3: Still Lifes](http://www.colourcow.com/still-life-drawing/)

Seeing everything around you as shapes and angles is universal for learning to draw. Whether you will draw comics, portraits, scifi space battles or abstract art, this is the first step. But the next step depends on your goal.

## Having Fun
**What do you want to draw?** Characters, animals, portraits, comics, ...?

There's a lot of studying to drawing. You have to get thousands of bad drawings out of you before you become really really good. Some days you'll create beautiful work, other days nothing comes out right. Having a goal and drawing for fun will help you stick to it long-term!

A good guideline is to divide your time 50-50 between practice and FUN drawings.

Doodling is good, it keeps your passion alive!

## Drawing the Face
A lot of artists start with portraits. Yet this is the most difficult to do well and you're guaranteed a lot of learning. We see humans every day. So when something is slightly "off" in a drawing of a person, we immediately spot it.

Portraits are interesting to draw, very popular and also frustrating. Because it's so difficult to master, keep an eye on you having fun with it. If you get frustrated easily, mix it up with other drawings. Why not draw a rhino? Even if you mess it up, it will still look like a rhino.

There's a ton of learning resources for drawing humans, in the sidebar you'll find Proko and Loomis, which are free to use!

## How to learn/practice
Observation, theory, imagination. Those are the three elements of learning to draw. The order is not that important.

Let's look at two examples:

1. You are drawing a barefoot character, but when you get to the feet you have trouble (= imagination) . You look at an anatomy book and watch a tutorial on feet (= theory) . Then you also grab a picture of feet in the pose you wanted to draw and draw it as a study, so you understand the theory you just learned better (= observation).

Now you can continue drawing from imagination, or correct your own drawing and the cycle continues whenever you discover a weak area.

2. You read a book about rendering and learn about reflective materials (= theory). With a photo reference, you try to paint a sphere made of metallic material (= observation). When you later on paint one of your vehicle sketches, you use what you learned to pick the right colours (= imagination)

Why do you need all three? When working from imagination, you'll understand your weakest areas and your strong areas. This way you know exactly what to study to improve. Theory can point out the logic behind what you see in real life, like when you see a gradient in a shadow, theory will explain to you how bounce light causes that gradient. By observation on the other hand, you can see the theory you learned in action so, like when you learn about a muscle and now in observation you see the shape it makes on a body.
