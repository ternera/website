# Where Do I Start?

If you're brand new to painting, start by familiarizing yourself with handling paint, understanding brushwork, and mixing colors. We'll break it down into approachable exercises:

1. **Day 1: Exploring Brush Strokes** — Learn how different brushes (round, flat, filbert) create unique marks. Experiment with straight lines, curves, and dots.
2. **Day 2: Monochrome Painting** — Use just black and white paint to create a simple still life. This helps you understand value (light and dark) without worrying about color.
3. **Day 3: Color Mixing Basics** — Practice making secondary colors (green, purple, orange) by mixing primary colors (red, blue, yellow). Gradually create a full-color wheel.

For structured learning, recommended resources:

# But I've Never Painted Before!

No problem! Just like learning to draw begins with seeing shapes, painting begins with learning how to control paint.

**Quick Start:**

1. Grab a paper towel
2. Dip a brush in watered-down paint
3. Make different strokes

Painting can be messy—embrace it! Share your work on r/painting for feedback.

# Do I Need Talent to Paint?

Nope! Success comes from:

* **Observation** — Notice colors, light, and shadows
* **Experimentation** — Mix colors and try new tools
* **Self-Critique** — Regularly assess your progress

# Am I Too Old to Start?

It’s never too late to learn! Many artists have started in their 30s, 50s, or later and achieved incredible progress. Stick with it for a few months, and you’ll be amazed at your improvement.

# How Long Will It Take to Get Good?

There’s no set timeline. If you paint every day, even for 15–30 minutes, you’ll improve much faster than you expect. Focus on building consistency.

The 10,000-hour rule applies to painting too: deliberate, focused practice leads to mastery.

# Can I Make a Living as a Painter?

Yes, but it’s competitive. You can explore careers in fine art, illustration, or digital concept art. Many artists supplement their income with teaching, commissions, or selling prints.

# Developing a Style

Your unique style will emerge naturally as you paint more and learn what excites you. Study artists whose work you admire, and try replicating their techniques to understand their process. Combine influences to create something uniquely yours.

# Motivation and Fun

Painting can be as relaxing or challenging as you want it to be. Mix up practice sessions with playful projects:

* Paint a landscape in under 10 minutes.
* Create a color palette inspired by your favorite movie scene.
