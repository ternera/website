# Getting Started with Pixel Art

# Where do I start?

If you're new to pixel art, the first step is understanding what makes it unique. Unlike traditional drawing, pixel art is about working with small grids of individual pixels — each pixel is a tiny square of color, and together they form a larger picture. This style requires precision and planning, but with practice, you can create beautiful, detailed art!

To build foundational skills, follow these beginner exercises that we lay out:

# Day 1: Understanding Pixels

1. Open a basic pixel art tool (like [Piskel](https://www.piskelapp.com/), [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/), or [Grafx2](http://grafx2.chez.com/)).
2. Read helpful books like [Make Your Own Pixel Art: Create Graphics for Games, Animations, and More!](https://amzn.to/40GgPpr) by Jennifer Dawe, [Learning Pixel Art](https://amzn.to/40OIFzX) by Max Hervieux, or [Pixel Art for Game Developers](https://amzn.to/3PJMAYl) by Daniel Silber.
3. Start by creating a 16x16 or 32x32 grid. Draw simple shapes like circles, squares, and lines. Learn to place each pixel thoughtfully to create smooth curves and straight lines.
4. Practice mirroring and symmetry.

# Day 2: Working with a Limited Palette

1. Choose a small color palette (like 4 to 8 colors) and draw a simple object like an apple or a tree.
2. Experiment with shading using dithering — a technique where you alternate colors to create the illusion of gradients.

# Day 3: Drawing Small Characters

1. Design a tiny character (16x16 pixels) using simple shapes for the body, head, and limbs. Focus on silhouette and readability.

# But I Can’t Even Draw a Stick Figure!

Yes, you can! In pixel art, simplicity is your friend. Even a few well-placed pixels can convey a character or a landscape. Look at minimalist pixel art for inspiration — it’s all about choosing what details to keep or simplify.

Here’s a tip: Start by copying simple sprites from classic 8-bit games like Super Mario or Pokémon. Notice how they use just a few pixels to create expressive designs. This helps you understand proportions and style solutions.

# Do I Need Talent?

Nope. Just like drawing, pixel art improves with consistent practice. Talent helps you start faster, but deliberate practice — learning shading, proportions, and palette control — leads to lasting improvement. To practice with purpose:

* **Observation:** Study pixel art from games or artists you admire.
* **Self-Critique:** Reflect on what worked well in your art and what didn’t.
* **Copy and Modify:** Replicate simple sprites to understand techniques, then tweak them to make them your own.

# What Program Do I Use?

# Free Tools:

* [Piskel](https://www.piskelapp.com/) (browser-based)
* [Pixilart](https://www.pixilart.com/)
* [Krita](https://krita.org/en/) (supports pixel art)

# Paid Tools:

* [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/) (highly recommended for serious pixel artists)
* [GraphicsGale](https://graphicsgale.com/us/)

# What Should I Draw?

Start small! Here are some beginner-friendly ideas:

* A tiny character (16x16 or 32x32 pixels).
* A simple house or tree.
* A smiley face, heart, or basic emoji.

Gradually, you’ll want to create more detailed art. Remember: pixel art is as much about planning as it is about drawing. Work at a zoomed-in level, but regularly zoom out to see how your design looks from a distance.

# Color Palettes

A limited palette is a pixel artist’s best friend. Choose pre-made palettes to simplify your process. Try:

* Dawnbringer’s 16-color palette (great for learning).
* Lospec’s Palette List (lospec.com) for free community-created palettes.

**Pro Tip:** Fewer colors force you to think creatively. Mastering small palettes teaches strong shading and design.

# Tips and Tricks

* **Pixel Placement Matters:** Every pixel counts. Avoid jagged lines and watch how you connect pixels to create smoother curves.
* **Shading with Dithering:** Use checkerboard patterns to blend two colors and create texture.
* **Outlines:** Experiment with dark outlines, colored outlines, or no outlines to find what works best for your style.

# How Long Does It Take to Get Good?

Like any art form, it depends on your practice. Pixel art is great because small projects — even a sprite or simple landscape — can be completed quickly. Start with 30-minute sessions, working daily or a few times a week.

# Deliberate Practice:

* Redraw your favorite pixel art after a month of practice.
* Challenge yourself with new exercises, like animating a bouncing ball.

# Pixel Art Jobs

Pixel art is used in indie games, icons, and retro-style illustrations. While it’s not as lucrative as some other art careers, many artists sell commissions, game assets, or tutorials. Browse platforms like [itch.io](http://itch.io) or or our work thread in r/PixelArt to explore job options.

Pixel art is all about patience and attention to detail. Stick with it, enjoy the process, and share your work to get feedback and stay motivated.
